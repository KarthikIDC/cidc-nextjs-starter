        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web
        development by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes. These
        classes enable rapid styling without writing custom CSS, promoting
        consistency and scalability. Tailwindâ€™s approach shifts focus from
        traditional CSS components to functional classes, empowering developers
        to efficiently build responsive and visually appealing interfaces with
        minimal effort.
